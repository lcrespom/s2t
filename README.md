A small experiment with Speech to Text API

## ToDo
- See http://www.ashsh.org/2016/01/making-my-own-speech-to-text-engine.html
	for open source options
- See http://www.voxforge.org/ for list of open source engines
	...apparently no Spanish support.
- Test existing API
- See if sound source can be provided for web speech recognition
